**Welcome the nRc co-operative R coding group!**

**25-MAY-2022**

To download the scripts and datasets for each session, click the green "Code" button and unlock the files as zip files. 
Unzip the files from your "Downloads" section on your computer, then move the files to the folder you will be using as your working directory. 
If you get lost, do not worry -- I will walk through these steps on our first session!
